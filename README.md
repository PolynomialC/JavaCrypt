# JavaCrypt
JCE implmentations

#PROJECT 1

  Symmetric Password based encryption with brute force char set attack.
  A java program which demonstrates the JCE accompanied with a naive brute force attack. 

#PROJECT 2


Asymmetric (public key cryptography implmentation).
 Program uses RSA encryption, AES hashing & implements an adversary attack class. 
 
 
 #TO-DO
   
 1.Update the encryption provider
 2.Alter the char set params. 
 3.Implement more appropriate timer algorithm.
